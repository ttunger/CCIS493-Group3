# HaircutBookingSystem
UserStory1 - Complete with exceptions:
  - The application runs as intended with the Appointment Request Form
  - Upon Completion of the Appointment Request, a Confirmation Screen is presented
  - No Database as of the completion of this User Story, meaning Appointments are not stored
  - Email Services has been removed as a feature of the Final Product
  - We are pushing to have this Application run from a LAN Server rather than being published online.
