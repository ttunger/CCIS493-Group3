# HaircutBookingSystem

During this sprint, I contributed across planning, quality, and technical prioritization areas, helping set the team up for the next iteration while improving the current product’s reliability and clarity.

Backlog and user stories

- Authored detailed user stories and organized the sprint backlog for the upcoming iteration, ensuring each item was clearly scoped, prioritized, and aligned with product goals.
- Collaborated with stakeholders to refine acceptance criteria and dependencies so the team can estimate and execute more predictably in the next sprint.

Validation and testing support

- Assisted with reviewing and testing validation behavior in the application, confirming that inputs, error handling, and messaging behaved as expected against defined requirements.
- Partnered with developers and QA to document issues found during validation, helping to tighten feedback loops and reduce defect leakage.

Edge case analysis

- Identified various edge cases in application flows and data handling, highlighting scenarios that could impact users but might be missed in standard test paths.
- Communicated these edge cases to the team and ensured they were captured as test scenarios or backlog items, improving test coverage and product resilience.

Database priority feedback

- Provided feedback on database-related work within the sprint, helping clarify which schema changes, performance improvements, or data quality tasks should take precedence.
- Worked with the team to balance database technical debt against feature delivery, ensuring that critical backend dependencies were addressed early to reduce future risk.
