Sprint I Tasks

Conducted work on user story 7. Ran into issues integrating with database and maintaining persistance over multiple sessions.
Conducted troubleshooting with group mates regarding user story 7 in an attempt to progress further.
Issue persisted and fellow group mates decided it would be ideal to move the story to Sprint 3 in order to iron out issues with
database system.

Tested completed modules that are currently uploaded to GitHub to include database.

Helped conduct planning for Sprint 3, reorganizing the user stories appropriately.
Identified which stories were behind and which stories remained for the final sprint.
Assigned stories to each member of the group to appropriatley complete remaining stories.
