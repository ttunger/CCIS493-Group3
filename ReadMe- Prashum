Name: Prashum K.C.
Course: CISS 493 – Capstone
Team: Group 3

Sprint: Sprint 1

What I submitted:
- Added the initial database schema script `01_core_tables.sql` under the Database folder for the HaircutBookingSystem.
- The script creates the core tables: Users, Stylists, AppointmentTypes, Appointments, and StylistNotes.
- Ran the script on my local SQL Server instance to create the HaircutBookingSystem database and verified there were no SQL errors.

What should be working:
- Primary keys, foreign keys, and basic constraints (like the Role check and status values) are in place.
- The structure supports booking appointments, linking clients to stylists, and storing stylist notes.

What is not working / still to be done:
- The web application is not yet connected to this database (no connection string or DbContext wired up yet).
- No seed data for real users, stylists, or services beyond the schema.
- No authentication or real password hashing implemented yet; PasswordHash is a placeholder column for now.


Sprint 2

What I completed:
- Improved input validation for bookings on both frontend and backend.
- Added clear error messages for invalid service, stylist, date, and time selections.
- Enforced 30-minute time increments and prevented past-date bookings.
- Updated BookingController.cs with stronger ModelState checks and safer logic.
- Added RemindersResult.cshtml for testing the reminder feature from Sprint 1.
- Updated Index.cshtml so validation messages display correctly.

What should be working:
- Booking form now blocks invalid inputs and provides clear feedback.
- Backend rejects malformed requests or missing fields.
- Reminder test page shows upcoming appointments within 24 hours.

What is not working / still to be done:
- No actual email sending yet (reminders only displayed for testing).
- No real database integration — system still uses in-memory lists.
- Reminder logic will need to be connected to real appointments after DB is added.
