What I submitted:
- Added the initial database schema script `01_core_tables.sql` under the Database folder for the HaircutBookingSystem.
- The script creates the core tables: Users, Stylists, AppointmentTypes, Appointments, and StylistNotes.
- Ran the script on my local SQL Server instance to create the HaircutBookingSystem database and verified there were no SQL errors.

What should be working:
- Primary keys, foreign keys, and basic constraints (like the Role check and status values) are in place.
- The structure supports booking appointments, linking clients to stylists, and storing stylist notes.

What is not working / still to be done:
- The web application is not yet connected to this database (no connection string or DbContext wired up yet).
- No seed data for real users, stylists, or services beyond the schema.
- No authentication or real password hashing implemented yet; PasswordHash is a placeholder column for now.
